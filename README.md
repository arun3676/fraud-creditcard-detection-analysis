# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. Financial fraud is a significant issue affecting individuals and businesses worldwide, and early detection is crucial for preventing losses. We will analyze the dataset to understand patterns in fraudulent transactions and build models to predict and detect fraud. Additionally, we will perform time series analysis to forecast transaction amounts and anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns.

## Objectives

- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its features.
- Handle data imbalance using techniques like resampling or synthetic data generation.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Perform time series analysis to forecast transaction amounts.
- Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns in the data.

## Summary of Tasks

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: To understand the dataset's structure, identify missing values, and observe the distribution of the target variable (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions).
- **Techniques**: Summary statistics, missing value analysis, distribution plots.

### Handling Data Imbalance
- **Objective**: To balance the dataset, ensuring the machine learning models can effectively learn from both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Techniques**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

### Building and Evaluating Machine Learning Models
- **Objective**: To build models that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Techniques**: Using Random Forest Classifier, evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Time Series Analysis
- **Objective**: To forecast future transaction amounts using historical data.
- **Techniques**: Using the Prophet library for time series forecasting.

### Anomaly Detection
- **Objective**: To identify unusual patterns or outliers in the dataset that may indicate fraudulent activity.
- **Techniques**: Using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated how advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques could be applied to detect financial fraud, forecast transaction trends, and identify anomalies in the dataset. These insights are crucial for enhancing financial security, optimizing business strategies, and improving overall data-driven decision-making.
